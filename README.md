PiSeas is a prototype for an automated fish tank, created with the incorporation of the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to control all the use cases and tasks required to sustain a habitable fish tank environment. 

Some functionalities of the tank include scheduled feedings, water temperature control, water changing, camera monitoring, light control, and water analysis. The data obtained from the built-in sensors within the tank is made available on the userâ€™s phone, and accessed through an app which we will also design and create. The app is able to connect to multiple fish tanks and will be able to monitor and control each individual tank in real time. The user is able to access real time tank information as well as schedule tasks for the system to maintain an optimal aquatic habitat.
